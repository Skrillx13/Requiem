# Requiem: Pythonic Common Gamesâ„¢

Project Release V1.0 [(Install it now!)](./intro/installation.md)

A Python library for creating simple common games, and displaying them on the web.

---

**Requiem** provides you the tools required to easily make simple common games, such as chess, 2048, number guessing, sissors paper stone, ect... all within Python. The vanilla way of making games in Python is difficult, so why not just use a libary to simplify it?

Check it out with a simple example:

``` python
# An example for Python Chess
import requiem

board = chess.Board()

board.legal_moves  
<LegalMoveGenerator at ... (Nh3, Nf3, Nc3, Na3, h3, g3, f3, e3, d3, c3, ...)>
chess.Move.from_uci("a8a1") in board.legal_moves
False

board.push_san("e4")
Move.from_uci('e2e4')
board.push_san("e5")
Move.from_uci('e7e5')
board.push_san("Qh5")
Move.from_uci('d1h5')
board.push_san("Nc6")
Move.from_uci('b8c6')
board.push_san("Bc4")
Move.from_uci('f1c4')
board.push_san("Nf6")
Move.from_uci('g8f6')
board.push_san("Qxf7")
Move.from_uci('h5f7')

board.is_checkmate()
True

board
Board('r1bqkb1r/pppp1Qpp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4')
```
